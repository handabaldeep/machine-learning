Aim- Implement a dynamic programming function calculating coefficients alpha, beta, and gamma for a hidden Markov model. 

Sample- The files M.txt, B.txt, and p.txt contain the transition matrix, the emission matrix, and the initial probabilities for a hmm with 12 hidden states and 10 observable states. The file v.txt contains a sequence of 20 observed states.

Result- Run the functions defined on the above data and calculate the matrices of betas and gammas. Extract the values β 18 (3) and γ 10 (5).
